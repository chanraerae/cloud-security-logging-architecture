# Logical Log Flow

A reliable cloud logging architecture follows a clear flow.

1. Event generation at the service or platform level
2. Centralized collection with minimal transformation
3. Secure storage with integrity controls
4. Controlled access for investigation and audit
5. Downstream use by detection and response systems

Each stage introduces potential failure modes.

Understanding where logs can be lost, delayed, or altered is critical for security reliability.
